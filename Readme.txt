The Perl code here is not fully functional, but is provided as a starting base for a working prototype.

It is my hope and intention that the Perl and open source community can offer contributions to turn this sample code into a working prototype. Contributions in terms of source code changes/additions, or advice/tips for suggested changes. Later on, could use "testers" to test out the working prototype.

FYI, this code here is for a remote server interface for remote test libraries built with Perl for use with RobotFramework.org.

Robot Framework currently has remote server implementations (and thus support) for Python, Ruby, .NET, and Java. The Robot Framework project would also like to have a Perl version but no one had the resource or expertise to build one. I made an attempt and this is it. 

I don't see why we can't build a Perl version. I don't think it may be that hard, but since I'm not a Perl guru, and Perl is one of those few languages that can be very simple to very cryptically complex, I need your help...
