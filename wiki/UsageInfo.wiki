This generic remote library implementation is similar to the Python reference implementation in use but still slightly different. See the following for reference.

http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/RemoteLibrary

http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/tools/remoteserver/example/examplelibrary.py

To use it, see  [http://code.google.com/p/plrobotremoteserver/source/browse/trunk/exampleremoteserver.pl exampleremoteserver.pl] for details. 

But basically to use it, you write a Perl script to load the remote library module along with your test library module, or you can opt to instead implement your test library code in this Perl script rather than loading it externally.

Then in the Perl script, you instantiate the remote server passing it the name of the test library package/class to use, and optionally specify other parameters like server hostname/IP address, server port, and whether to allow remotely stopping server or not.

Finally, you start the server by executing the start server method. Here is an excerpt of sample code:

{{{
  #!/usr/bin/env perl

  #use strict;
  #use warnings;

  use lib '.'; #add local path to Perl modules, etc.
  #alternatively, for modules under lib subdirectory of local path...
  #use lib 'lib';

  #import & reference generic remote server for Robot Framework
  use RobotRemoteServer;

  # import & reference the Robot Framework Perl test library/module
  use ExampleLibrary;
  #or alternatively implement the test library in this file

  #create instance of remote server with specified library
  my $remote_svr = new RobotRemoteServer("ExampleLibrary");

  $remote_svr->start_server();

  #ending script/module return value to append below
  1;
}}}

To use the XML-RPC server, you have to use the URL format of http://host:port/RPC2. Once server is started, you can call test library keywords offered by the server from Robot Framework. Or you can test same using plain XML-RPC requests following the Robot Framework spec.
